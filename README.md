Introduction
====
A Smart Model for Epigenetics in Plants (SMEP) was constructed to identify various epigenomic sites using deep neural networks (DNNs) approach. The SMEP prediction leverages associations with DNA 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and N6-methyladenosine (6mA) methylation, RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation, histone H3 lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), H3K27me3, and H3 lysine-9 acetylation (H3K9ac). 

System requirement
=====
1. Python 2.7 or Python 3.5
2. tensorflow 2.0.0
3. keras 2.3.1
4. theano 1.0.4

Quick Start
====
1. Install the python 2.7 or 3.5 from Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/
2. pip install tensorflow==2.0.0
3. pip install keras==2.3.1
4. pip install theano==1.0.4
5. git clone https://github.com/BRITian/smep

Training
====
The program smep_prediction_py2.7.py or smep_prediction_py3.5.py was selected to train the prediction model, in the python environment 2.7 or 3.5, respectively. The four parameters should be provided t
