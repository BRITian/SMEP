Introduction
====
A Smart Model for Epigenetics in Plants (SMEP) was constructed to identify various epigenomic sites using deep neural networks (DNNs) approach. The SMEP prediction leverages associations with DNA 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and N6-methyladenosine (6mA) methylation, RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation, histone H3 lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), H3K27me3, and H3 lysine-9 acetylation (H3K9ac). 

System requirement:
=====
1. Python 2.7 or Python 3.5
2. tensorflow 2.0.0
3. keras 2.3.1
4. theano 1.0.4
