A Smart Model for Epigenetics in Plants (SMEP) was constructed to identify various epigenomic sites using deep neural networks (DNNs) approach. The SMEP prediction leverages associations with DNA 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and N6-methyladenosine (6mA) methylation, RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation, histone H3 lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), H3K27me3, and H3 lysine-9 acetylation (H3K9ac). This website yielded substantial accuracy for predicting various epigenetic marks, and permitted searching epigenetic marks and gene expression.
